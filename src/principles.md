title: CARE and FAIR principles (Annotated for PILARS)

The [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) (@wilkinsonFAIRGuidingPrinciples2016) and/or [CARE](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/6397b363b502ff481fce6baf/1670886246948/CARE%2BPrinciples_One%2BPagers%2BFINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf) (@carrollCAREPrinciplesIndigenous2020a) principles are frequently mandated in various contexts around the world, including for outputs of the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)

These principles are not a DIY manual that can be simply adopted by researchers — to implement a system that supports CARE and FAIR research requires development of infrastructure and governance frameworks. The RRKive principles and website are aimed at those undertaking these substantial tasks.

This document contains a copy of each set of principles, with notes about how PILARS is designed to help implement them.

## Care Principles

><a name="CARE-C"> </a>
>
>###  CARE-C: Collective Benefit
>
>Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.
>
><a name="CARE-C1"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-C1: 	For inclusive development and innovation
>
>    Governments and institutions must actively support the use and reuse of data by Indigenous nations and communities by facilitating the establishment of the foundations for Indigenous innovation, value generation, and the promotion of local self-determined development processes.
>
><a name="CARE-C2"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-C2: 	For improved governance and citizen engagement
>
>    Data enrich the planning, implementation, and evaluation processes that support the service and policy needs of Indigenous communities. Data also enable better engagement between citizens, institutions, and governments to improve decision-making.
>
>    Ethical use of open data has the capacity to improve transparency and decision-making by providing Indigenous nations and communities with a better understanding of their peoples, territories, and resources. It similarly can provide greater insight into third-party policies and programs affecting Indigenous Peoples.
>
><a name="CARE-C3"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-C3: 	For equitable outcomes
>
>    Indigenous data are grounded in community values, which extend to society at large. Any value created from Indigenous data should benefit Indigenous communities in an equitable manner and contribute to Indigenous aspirations for wellbeing.
>
><a name="CARE-A"> </a>
>
>###  CARE-A: Authority to Control
>
>Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data.
>
><a name="CARE-A1"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-A1:   Recognizing rights and interests
>
>    Indigenous Peoples have rights and interests in both Indigenous Knowledge and Indigenous data. Indigenous Peoples have collective and individual rights to free, prior, and informed consent in the collection and use of such data, including the development of data policies and protocols for collection.
>
><a name="CARE-A2"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-A2:   Data for governance
>
>    Indigenous Peoples have the right to data that are relevant to their world views and empower self-determination and effective self-governance. Indigenous data must be made available and accessible to Indigenous nations and communities in order to support Indigenous governance.
>
><a name="CARE-A3"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-A3:   Governance of data
>
>    Indigenous Peoples have the right to develop cultural governance protocols for Indigenous data and be active leaders in the stewardship of, and access to, Indigenous data especially in the context of Indigenous Knowledge.
>
><a name="CARE-R"> </a>
>
>###  CARE-R: Responsibility
>
>Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ selfdetermination and collective benefit. Accountability requires meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the benefits accruing to Indigenous Peoples.
>
><a name="CARE-R1"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-R1: For positive relationships
>
>    Indigenous data use is unviable unless linked to relationships built on respect, reciprocity, trust, and mutual understanding, as defined by the Indigenous Peoples to whom those data relate. Those working with Indigenous data are responsible for ensuring that the creation, interpretation, and use of those data uphold, or are respectful of, the dignity of Indigenous nations and communities.
>
><a name="CARE-R2"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-R2: For expanding capability and capacity
>
>    Use of Indigenous data invokes a reciprocal responsibility to enhance data literacy within Indigenous communities and to support the development of an Indigenous data workforce and digital infrastructure to enable the creation, collection, management, security, governance, and application of data.
>
><a name="CARE-R3"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-R3: For Indigenous languages and worldviews
>
>    Resources must be provided to generate data grounded in the languages, worldviews, and lived experiences (including values and principles) of Indigenous Peoples.
>
><a name="CARE-E"> </a>
>
>###  CARE-E: Ethics
>
>Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.
>
><a name="CARE-E1"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-E1:   For minimizing harm and maximizing benefit
>
>    Ethical data are data that do not stigmatize or portray Indigenous Peoples, cultures, or knowledges in terms of deficit. Ethical data are collected and used in ways that align with Indigenous ethical frameworks and with rights affirmed in UNDRIP. Assessing ethical benefits and harms should be done from the perspective of the Indigenous Peoples, nations, or communities to whom the data relate.
>
><a name="CARE-E2"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-E2:   For justice
>
>    Ethical processes address imbalances in power, resources, and how these affect the expression of Indigenous rights and human rights. Ethical processes must include representation from relevant Indigenous communities.
>
><a name="CARE-E3"> </a>
>
>-  CARE-E3:   For future use
>
>    Data governance should take into account the potential future use and future harm based on ethical frameworks grounded in the values and principles of the relevant Indigenous community. Metadata should acknowledge the provenance and purpose and any limitations or obligations in secondary use inclusive of issues of consent.

## FAIR Principles

>
>To be Findable:

><a name="FAIR-F1"> </a>
>
>-  FAIR-F1: (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and *persistent* identifier
>
><a name="FAIR-F2"> </a>
>
>-  FAIR-F2: Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)

>
><a name="FAIR-F4"> </a>
>
>-  FAIR-F4: (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

#### Notes

Yes, data and metadata should be assigned PIDs (Persistent IDs), but there are a lot of requirements that follow from this. Persistent identifiers require persistent availability, via Archival Repository infrastructure for storing well-described data. It is not a given that suitable Archival Repository infrastructure exists; hence, the PILARS protocols are aimed at those creating or procuring it. It is critical that discussions of FAIR implementations include discussions of these underlying implications, otherwise, there is a risk in focussing on easily-measured things like "which persistent ID scheme is used" or "how many persistent IDs have you issued", rather than first asking "where's the data and how are you making sure it is available over the long term?"

>### FAIR-A: Accessible
>
>To be Accessible:
>
><a name="FAIR-A1"> </a>

>-  FAIR-A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol
>
><a name="FAIR-A1.1"> </a>

>  - FAIR-A1.1: The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
>
><a name="FAIR-A1.2"> </a>

>
><a name="FAIR-A2"> </a>
>
>-  FAIR-A2: Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

#### Notes

If we're going to observe the CARE principles, then A1.2 *an authentication and authorization procedure* is DEFINITELY needed — but this is not a trivial undertaking. While A1 can be implemented by using standard web protocols (chiefly HTTPS) with protocols and standards built on top it (linked data, metadata harvesting protocols, such as OAI-PMH), there is a lack of web-scale standardisation in mediating access to resources.
