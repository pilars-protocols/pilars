<h2 id="storage-layout-for-protocol-1">Storage layout for <a
href="./index.html#1"
title="Data is Portable: assets are not locked-in to a particular mode of storage, interface or service">Protocol
1</a></h2>
<p>Very sensitive data might need to be stored on physically secured
storage, such as hard drives stored in a safe or an air-gapped server,
and a variety of storage systems might need to be combined for a large
collection (e.g. public data stored in the cloud, access-controlled data
kept locally). Encrypting sensitive data can allow technologists to work
on the servers without being able to see the data, but the data might
not be recoverable if the encryption keys are lost.</p>
<p>Storage directory-like hierarchies might group data together in
collections or by rights-holder on similar paths, to aid in moving data
between services using file-system tools (unlike approaches which
completely obscure all meaning in paths using hash algorithms, for
reasons such as optimising the storage address space).</p>
<p>However, to avoid ambiguity in implementing <a
href="./index.html#1.2.2"
title="Each Storage Object is a directory (or storage object equivalent) containing the files including metadata and administrative files such as checksums that make up an Object.">Protocol
1.2.2</a>, a specification, for example, OCFL, might require that object
paths on the storage root must not be nested within each other.</p>
<p>Deciding on the granularity of objects, <a href="./index.html#1.2"
title="Divide up data files into [Storage Objects] that form meaningful units, of smallest practical size.">Protocol
1.2</a> involves considering a number of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Files with the same licensing conditions for re-use should be
grouped together.</p></li>
<li><p>If some content might need to be withdrawn or withheld for
cultural, ethical or legal reasons, then objects should be packaged so
that this can be done without having to create new versions of
objects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="applications-notes">Applications notes</h3>
<p>Regarding <a href="./index.html#1.7"
title="If data resides in systems, such as content management systems or database applications which do not inherently support all of the protocols 1 &amp; 2 then put processes in place to export data to a system that does.">Protocol
1.7</a>: Ideally, this is something that should not be necessary, but if
not, then work to bring systems into line with PILARS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t design or build systems that don’t have this exit pathway
designed from the start.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t place data in systems that don’t have this
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to add this straight away if existing systems don’t have
this.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./index.html#1.3"
title="Document and implement an ID resolution mapping system to map IDs to storage locations (FAIR-F1).">Protocol
1.3</a> (that an ID resolution method is in place and documented)
ensures that data can be referenced remotely and inter-object
relationships within a repository are supported. This supports <a
href="./index.html#2.5"
title="Represent Repository Collections such as archival series or other organising entities as Storage Objects; either self-contained with their member data within the Storage Object or as metadata-only Storage Objects referencing or referenced by other Storage Objects.">Protocol
2.5</a>, which means a <a href="./index.html#storage-object">Storage
Object</a> can be located without requiring the repository to be indexed
using the ID-to-path algorithm.</p>
<p>The Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification was developed to
support a similar set of requirements to <a href="./index.html#1"
title="Data is Portable: assets are not locked-in to a particular mode of storage, interface or service">Protocol
1</a>, and is being widely implemented in repository and digital library
systems. LDaCA uses OCFL and has demonstrated that it works at the scale
of tens of thousands of objects and millions of files.</p>
<p><em>OCFL is a compliant implementation solution for <a
href="./index.html#1"
title="Data is Portable: assets are not locked-in to a particular mode of storage, interface or service">Protocol
1</a> to ensure data portability.</em></p>
<p>A simpler alternative storage based on different standards would be
to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use a directory hierarchy on a POSIX-compliant storage
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Signal that the directory is a Storage Object (<a
href="./index.html#1.2"
title="Divide up data files into [Storage Objects] that form meaningful units, of smallest practical size.">Protocol
1.2</a>) by the presence of a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt">BagIt</a> manifest in a
directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BagIt files nested below this Storage Object would not be
considered Storage Objects in their own right in the context of the
repository.</p></li>
<li><p>BagIt provides checksums as per <a href="./index.html#2.4"
title="Store checksum-metadata in a documented standard format alongside data files to help ensure data integrity.">Protocol
2.4</a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Use a documented and implementable algorithm to map object IDs to
a path and store a summary in the root of the directory
hierarchy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that neither this example using BagIt nor OCFL implement <a
href="./index.html#2"
title="Data is Annotated: contents, structure, provenance and access and reuse permissions are comprehensively described with metadata and licenses">Protocol
2</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="metadata-standards-and-specifications---protocol-2">Metadata
Standards and Specifications - <a href="./index.html#2"
title="Data is Annotated: contents, structure, provenance and access and reuse permissions are comprehensively described with metadata and licenses">Protocol
2</a></h2>
<h3 id="why-is-linked-data-metadata-required">Why is <a
href="./index.html#linked-data-metadata">Linked Data Metadata</a>
required?</h3>
<p>Linked Data allows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>any conceivable data structure to be described in metadata, and
there is no limit to the size and scope of the description</p></li>
<li><p>extensibility: vocabularies to be mixed in as needed, from a core
set for all data to domain-specific to project or even dataset-specific
terms; this can be formalised using Profiles</p></li>
<li><p>interoperability with contemporary global research information
systems architectures, discovery services, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>inter-object relationships to be expressed – so that the physical
storage layout does not define the only way that resources can be
explored.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Linked data is often conflated with Open
Access; the phrase Linked Open Data is very common. But the Linked Data
principles can be applied to non-open access-controlled materials.
Non-open materials have some impact on how catalogues and indexes are
implemented; for example, using linked-data graphs such as triple stores
that contain multiple items might make access-control-safe queries
impossible to implement for reasons of complexity and performance; the
reasoning to work out whether a particular metadata statement can be
seen by a particular user could be very computationally expensive.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="vocabularies-and-metadata-profiles">Vocabularies and metadata
profiles</h3>
<p>Communities can maintain schemas/vocabularies for specific domains
(<a href="./principles.html#FAIR-R1.3"
title="(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards">FAIR-R1.3</a>)
and to document metadata profiles.</p>
<p>Documenting a profile can be as simple as writing a natural-language
document to describe what is expected in a particular context, but can
be further codified using Linked Data Schemas (or Ontologies or
Vocabularies), from which documentation and validation services might be
derived.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="licenses">Licenses</h2>
<p>The <a href="./principles.html#FAIR" title="FAIR Principles">FAIR</a>
principles mandate a <a href="./index.html#license">License</a> for data
(<a href="./principles.html#FAIR-R1.1"
title="(meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license">FAIR-R1.1</a>).</p>
<p>Licenses might be based on copyright law, or rely on other mechanisms
based on other rights (such as privacy or trade secrets). Licenses
should reflect the will of rights holders, and will likely be
administered, chosen or written by a <a
href="./index.html#data-steward">Data Steward or Custodian</a>
authorised to act on behalf of the rights holders, or by the rights
holder themselves.</p>
<p>It is important to have a license document independent of algorithms
or configuration file(s), and independently of a particular
authorisation system that might be built into a software application.
Implemented processes are, of course, needed to make data available, and
might include some automation. But to make data truly portable across
systems and time, it is essential that human-readable documentation is
available in case authorisation processes need to be rebuilt or
redesigned.</p>
<p>For <a href="./index.html#2.3.1"
title="It is critical that data that does not have an Open Access or public domain license is not exposed via a portal without access controls and that confidential licenses themselves are not disseminated. Licensing may change, be withdrawn and new licenses added over time.">Protocol
2.3.1</a>, an access-control system might need to be put in place if
there is non-open license data in the <a
href="./index.html#archival-repository">Archival Repository</a>. An
individual data access system might implement a range of solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lists of approved data licensees associated with logins local to
the system</p></li>
<li><p>a separate license management system or systems, where more than
one data access system can consult to see if a user holds a particular
license</p></li>
<li><p>manual offline access, with direct transfer of data to approved
applicants.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="logical-structure-collections">Logical Structure:
Collections</h3>
<p>The concept of a Collection is very commonly used in repositories and
digital archives to represent the ‘backbone’ of the way resources,
including sub-collections and Objects, are organised.</p>
<p>The choice of whether to store Collections as a single <a
href="./index.html#storage-object">Storage Object</a> (e.g. a directory
or directory-like node in a file hierarchy) or as a number of Storage
Objects might be influenced by several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the size of the object; finer granularity might be preferred to
keep Storage Objects at a manageable size</p></li>
<li><p>how likely the content is to change or be withdrawn, for example,
because a participant wishes to have content by or about them removed
from an <a href="./index.html#archival-repository">Archival
Repository</a>; a granularity of an Object per participant/creator or
cohort might make withdrawing access more manageable, by updating a <a
href="./index.html#license">License</a></p></li>
<li><p>whether there is a separation made between archival and
dissemination-ready copies of files, as per OAIS (<span class="citation"
data-cites="OAISReferenceModel"><span>“<span>OAIS Reference Model</span>
(<span>ISO</span> 14721)”</span> (n.d.)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>whether files are stored with, or separately from, annotations on
those files (such as transcripts)</p></li>
<li><p>licensing of objects; from an implementation point of view, it is
much simpler to have a single reuse license per Object than to try to
administer very granular permissions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To comply with <a href="./index.html#2.5"
title="Represent Repository Collections such as archival series or other organising entities as Storage Objects; either self-contained with their member data within the Storage Object or as metadata-only Storage Objects referencing or referenced by other Storage Objects.">Protocol
2.5</a>, <a href="./index.html#repository-collection">Repository
Collection</a> / <a href="./index.html#repository-object">Repostory
Object</a> relationships might be described using either exhaustive
lists of members with a property, such as the Portland Common Data
Model’s <code>pcdm:hasMember</code> property, or by referencing the
containing Collection from another Collection or Repository Object using
the equivalent property <code>pcdm:memberOf</code>.</p>
<p>Fragmented Objects can be linked back together using the for
presentation and access (this is one of the strengths of Linked Data),
for example, a recording and verbatim transcript might be stored
together in an Object available to a very limited cohort, while
anonymised transcripts and audio might be in another Object made broadly
available – but these can be cross-linked and presented as a single
entity to authorised users.</p>
<p>A variety of virtual Collection-like aggregations of Objects can be
created via metadata indexes using user interface devices, such as
search facets, to comply with <a href="./index.html#1"
title="Data is Portable: assets are not locked-in to a particular mode of storage, interface or service">Protocol
1</a> and <a href="./index.html#2"
title="Data is Annotated: contents, structure, provenance and access and reuse permissions are comprehensively described with metadata and licenses">Protocol
2</a>; these should be designed so that the metadata on which they
depend is stored with the data object, not solely in an application or
workspace environment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="governance">Governance</h3>
<p>The specifics of good governance are out of scope for these
protocols, so we confine ourselves to some notes.</p>
<p><a href="./index.html#3.3"
title="Deposit agreements are in place and documented setting out the rights needed for the Archival Repository as an organization to manage data">Protocol
3.3</a> and <a href="./index.html#3.4"
title="Processes are in place for disposal/deaccessioning if appropriate to the purpose.">Protocol
3.4</a> together mean (at least) two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>robust appraisal or sentencing practices</p></li>
<li><p>robust preservation processes have been established.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Digital Preservation Handbook (<span class="citation"
data-cites="digitalpreservationcoalitionDigitalPreservationHandbook2015">Coalition
(2015)</span>) has detailed practical advice about preservation-focussed
archival practice.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="compliant-metadata-specifications">Compliant Metadata
Specifications</h2>
<p>Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) (<span class="citation"
data-cites="soiland-reyesPackagingResearchArtefacts2022">Soiland-Reyes
et al. (2022)</span>) is a linked-data metadata specification based on
widely used Linked Data <a href="./index.html#open-specifications">Open
Specifications</a>. RO-Crate was developed as a packaging method for
describing datasets and their contents – which is a good match for
describing <a href="./index.html#storage-objects">Storage Objects</a>,
and is now being widely adopted in various research contexts. RO-Crate
has been demonstrated to work at scale in the Language Data Commons of
Australia (<a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/">LDaCA</a>) and <a
href="https://www.paradisec.org.au/">PARADISEC</a> as the basis for <a
href="./index.html#archival-repositories">Archival Repositories</a>.</p>
<p>RO-CRATE supports <a href="./index.html#2.5"
title="Represent Repository Collections such as archival series or other organising entities as Storage Objects; either self-contained with their member data within the Storage Object or as metadata-only Storage Objects referencing or referenced by other Storage Objects.">Protocol
2.5</a> via the inclusion of the Portland Common Data model, a schema
for describing repositories with classes for Collections, Objects and
Files (<span class="citation"
data-cites="DuraspacePcdm"><span>“Duraspace/Pcdm”</span>
(n.d.)</span>).</p>
<p><em>RO-Crate is a compliant choice for <a href="./index.html#2"
title="Data is Annotated: contents, structure, provenance and access and reuse permissions are comprehensively described with metadata and licenses">Protocol
2</a> in a PILARS implementation, and is used in both PARADISEC and
LDaCA.</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="software-implementation-approaches">Software Implementation
Approaches</h2>
<p>There are two important implementation approaches to storing metadata
in storage systems, which are discussed in this <a
href="https://bibwild.wordpress.com/2023/03/21/ocfl-and-source-of-truth-two-options/">blog
post</a> (<span class="citation"
data-cites="jrochkindOCFLSourceTruth2023">jrochkind (2023)</span>):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The metadata in the store is treated as the source of truth (this
is the approach implemented in the set of tools used by LDaCA).</p></li>
<li><p>A catalogue application maintains metadata, which is the source
of truth, and exports data to the data store (the approach taken by
PARADISEC).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="./index.html#1.7"
title="If data resides in systems, such as content management systems or database applications which do not inherently support all of the protocols 1 &amp; 2 then put processes in place to export data to a system that does.">Protocol
1.7</a> deals with this; it is important for the overall goals of these
protocols that there are systems in place to write well-described
(annotated) data to commodity storage.</p>
